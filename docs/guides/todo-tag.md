# Todo Tag

Having a **To Do** tag in your campaign can help organise what you want to work on next and keep track of entities that are works in progress. Entities that are tagged with your To-Do tag will automatically display on the tag. You can also set a dashboard widget to show you a list of entities with the tag, to further help you remember what you want to focus on.

## Dashboard widget

To keep up to date with your entities that require more work, we suggest creating an **entity list** widget on your dashboard, filtered to only show entities with your todo tag.

Go to a list of for example characters, and add the todo tag as a filter. After submitting the form, in the filter box, you can **copy filters to clipboard**. This will copy to your clipboard the filters you need to copy-paste in the widget's **filters** field.
