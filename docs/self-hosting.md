# Self-hosting Kanka

Kanka's free version can be self-hosted. The code can be found on [Github](https://github.com/owlchester/kanka), and here's the [installation documentation](https://github.com/owlchester/kanka/blob/develop/docs/running.md). This sets up multiple Docker machines to run Kanka and its services.

## Premium features

[Premium features](https://kanka.io/premium) such as higher upload files, [marketplace](https://marketplace.kanka.io) plugins or [custom CSS](/features/campaigns/theming) aren't available on the self-hosted version of Kanka.

## Support

Kanka's team **does not** provide support for self-hosting. However, we try and make it easy to do so.
