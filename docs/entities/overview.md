# Entities

You might be familiar with the concept of an article in traditional wiki software, where each entry is built on the same generic form. Kanka eschews this model, instead each page belongs to one of the strictly defined types, detailed below. We call the generic article an **entity**.

Every character, family, location, map, quest is an entity, but each has their own unique features and way to display data and allow you to interact with it.

The available types of entities in Kanka are fixed, so adding your own types isn't possible. We do this to allow each type to feel unique and have its own features that interact with the rest of the world. This also avoids the issue of traditional note-taking software being too ill-defined, leading to spending more time setting up your hierarchy rather than focusing on building your world.

Most entites have the same basic structure of a **name**, **type**, an **entry** field to describe the entity, an **image**, and **tags**, among other common fields. Characters than have more fields like a **title**, **gender**, **pronouns** etc, while a calendar will have **seasons** and **moons**.
