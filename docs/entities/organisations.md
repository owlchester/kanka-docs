# Organisations

A place to store your world's criminal syndicates, revolutionary guards, illuminaties and religions.

Organisations are linked to characters, which make up their "members".

Each member can have a superior (another member of the organisation), and a status confirming their current relation to the organisation (current member, ex member, unknown). The type field is a free-form to best describe their role in the campaign.
