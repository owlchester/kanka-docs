# Conversations

```{admonition} Deprecated
This module is deprecated, meaning it isn't getting any new updates and will eventually be removed from Kanka. This entity type can be [enabled](/features/campaigns/modules) in your campaign settings.
```

The conversation entity type allows for fictional conversation between characters of the world, or between members of the campaign.

## Types of conversations

Conversations are split between two types of participants.

* **Members**: Choose this option if you want members of the campaign to be able to write in the conversation.
* **Entities**: Choose this option if you want the conversation to be between entities of the campaign, like characters.

## Adding members

Once the conversation is created, you can add members to it by clicking on the "user" icon on the top-right.

```{admonition} Permissions
Adding members of the campaign still requires them to have the adequate permissions to view the conversation.
```
