# Races

The races module is a way to represent sci-fi and fantasy races of the characters of your world. If your world just has cyborg-gnomes, you can [disable the module](/features/campaigns/modules).

## Example

In a typical fantasy setting, you might have Elves, Hobbits, Dragons and Humans as humans. You can go into detail and create child-races to elves, for example *wood elves*, whose parent race would be *elf*.

## Issues with the name

Kanka is aware of the issue with the module's name. The community has been asked a few times about changing the module's name to a less charged term, but no consensus has ever been reached. Kanka's policy is now to follow along with whatever new term Hasbro chooses for D&D.

## Changing the entity type

If you've created many creatures but meant to create races instead, you can easily [bulk change their entity type](/guides/transform).
