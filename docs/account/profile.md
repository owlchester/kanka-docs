# Profile

Every account can control their [public profile](https://app.kanka.io/settings/profile). This controls how they appear throughout Kanka.

## Available fields

Here is a quick run down of the various fields and what they do.

* **Name**: your account name, displayed everywhere.
* **Profile name**: fill this out if for example you want your name on your public profile and the [plugins library](/plugins/plugins) to appear differently than in campaigns.
* **Bio**: This short text appears on your public profile page.
* **Last login sharing**: turned off by default, this allows others to see when you last logged in to Kanka in a [campaign's members page](/features/campaigns/members).
* **Subscription hiding**: an option to hide your name from the hall of fame.
* **Profile picture**: yo face.
