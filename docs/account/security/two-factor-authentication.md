# Two-factor authentication

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is an extra level of security when logging into Kanka. When 2FA is enabled on your account, you will be prompted to provide a **one time password** (OTP) on each login.

The OTP password is generated by a third party app on your mobile device like the Google Authenticator application ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605)).

## Who can use 2FA

**All users** who log in with an email and password have access to 2FA. For users who use Google, Twitter or Facebook login, 2FA can be enabled on those platforms instead of on Kanka.

## How to enable 2FA

Navigate to your [Account settings](https://app.kanka.io/settings/account). Scrolling down, you'll find a **Two-factor authentication** section. Your first step is to generate a QR code into your authenticator app of choice on your mobile device. We recommend Google's Authenticator App ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605)). This saves `Kanka (your@email)` in the app, and generates a new OTP code every few seconds.

Next up is inputting the OTP code shown in the authenticator app into Kanka below the QR code and clicking save. This will finish setting up 2FA on your account and require you to log in again, finalizing the process.

## How to disable 2FA

> We strongly encourage you to keep your two-factor authentication to secure your account.

Navigate to your [Account settings](https://app.kanka.io/settings/account) and scroll down to the **Two-factor authentication** section. There you can disable your 2FA setup after confirming.

## Does it prevent impersonating in Kanka?

If you are a non-admin member of a campaign, your campaign's admins can still [impersonate](/guides/testing-permissions#switching-to-another-user) you and aren't requested to put in a QR code.
