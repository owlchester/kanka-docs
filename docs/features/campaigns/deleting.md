# Deleting a campaign

To access the campaign deletion interface, click on Settings at the bottom of the sidebar, then Deletion.

## Requirements

To be able to delete a campaign, the following needs to be true.

- You need to be an admin of the campaign.
- You need to be the only member left in the campaign.

Members can be removed by going to the Members subpage of a campaign (Settings > Members). Removing other campaign admins is not possible, they will need to leave the campaign themselves.
