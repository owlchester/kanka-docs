# Default thumbnails

[Premium campaigns](https://kanka.io/premium) have an interface to define default thumbnails for entities with no attached image. This interface is available in `Settings > Default Thumbnail`. 

## Thumbnails

Thumbnails are uploaded for each entity type. For example, a default thumbnail can be uploaded for characters. When done this way, each character with no defined image will show the default thumbnail in the various lists of the campaign.
