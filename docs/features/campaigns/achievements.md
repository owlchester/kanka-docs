# Achievements

[Premium campaigns](https://kanka.io/premium) have a unique interface that tracks achievements of the campaign. This page is accessible in `Settings > Achivements`. 

## Levels

Achievements are split into several categories, each focused on a unique entity type. Each achievement is then later split up into levels, which get unlocked when the campaign has reached a level's number.

For example, to fully unlock the Character achievement, the campaign needs 500 characters.

Achievements and their levels are defined globally for all campaigns, and can't be edited by users. Process is recalculated every 24 hours.
