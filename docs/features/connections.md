# Entity Connections

The **Connections** subpage shows how an entity is tied to the rest of your campaign. It's a central place to understand its relationships, associations, and links to other entities.

## Manual Connections

By default, this page displays manual connections that have been added directly to this entity. These can include any kind of relationship or link you want to define, such as a character’s mentor, a city's allied factions, or a family's birthplace.

You can add as many connections as needed to reflect your world’s complexity. Mirrored connections will also appear here.

## Related Elements

Below the manual connections, you’ll find a **Related** elements section. This automatically lists other entities that reference this one, for example, if a character or location links to this entity in a custom field or through another relationship.

```{admonition} Info
Mentions (e.g., @Character) in entity text are not included in this list.
```

## Premium Feature: Visual Connection Map

If you're using a [Premium campaign](https://kanka.io/premium), you can access the **Connection Map**, a visual tool that displays the entity’s connections and related elements in a dynamic, interactive graph. It’s a great way to see the big picture and explore how your entities connect across the world.

As a campaign admin, you can set your [campaign to default](/features/campaigns/campaign-settings) to the visual map view instead of the table view when accessing the Connections subpage.
