# Ads

For our Kobolds (free users), ads are displayed throughout the campaign pages in Kanka. These ads are a list of ads based on your browsing experience, and third-party products and services in the general TTRPG (Tabletop Role Playing Game) space.

## Disabling ads

Ads can be disabled by [subscribing to Kanka](https://kanka.io/pricing) on any of the tiers. As long as your subscription is active, you won't see any ads while browsing Kanka.

## Premium campaigns

A [Premium campaign](https://kanka.io/premium) disables ads for any user viewing the campaign. This also applies for unlogged users viewing a premium campaign.
