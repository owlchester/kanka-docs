# Inventory

Every entity has a subpage called "Inventory" which is intended to track an entity's inventory. This makes sense when using Kanka for running a TTRPG.

## Why all entities?

A quest's inventory might be the planned loot. A location's might be a shop's sales. An org's might be the group's shared loot.

## Adding an item

When adding an item to the inventory, either a name can be provided, or a link to an existing entity.

## Layout

Items in the same "Position" get grouped together.
