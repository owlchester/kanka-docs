# Gallery

Every campaign has access to a gallery, a place to upload and re-use images throughout the campaign.

By default, free campaigns are limited to **150** (one hundred and fifty) MiB of images, while premium campaigns get up to **3** (three) GiB.

Only members of the campaign's **admin** role, or members in a role which has the **gallery** permission can access the whole gallery from the sidebar. Others can simply select images from the gallery, or upload to it from the text editor.

## Gallery Permissions

Roles have three permissions related to the gallery.

* **Full Control**, which grants members of the role full access to the gallery, including adding, editing, and deleting images from the gallery.
* **Browse**, which grants members of the role access to the gallery without being able to add, edit or delete images. They can still select images from the gallery to add to entities through the text editor.
* **Upload**, which grants members of the role the ability to upload images to the gallery through the text editor (and in the gallery if they have the **Browse** permission). Users who can only upload but can't browse can still select images from the gallery in the text editor, but will only see images they have uploaded.
