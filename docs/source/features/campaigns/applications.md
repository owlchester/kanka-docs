# Applications

Campaigns can be open to applications, allowing non-members to apply to join it through the dashboard. Controlling if a campaign is open or closed to applications, and approving or denying those applications is available in `World > Applications`.

## Applying

Applying to a campaign is done through the campaign's dashboard, which will have an `Apply` button at the top of the dashboard. This allows a user to send an application message, visible to the campaign's admins. The same button can be used to edit an application, or cancel it.

Campaigns that have open applications are searchable in the [Public campaigns](https://kanka.io/en-US/public-campaigns) interface.

## Approval

Campaign admins can approve or reject applications. When doing so, they can attach a message for the applicant, which will be displayed in their notifications.
