# Campaigns

A campaign, also known as a **world** or a **universe**, is the way data is stored in Kanka. Everything belongs to a campaign.

## Creating a campaign

To create a campaign, open the campaign switcher and click on **new campaign**.

## Campaign settings

The following aims to detail each field available when creating or editing a campaign. To access this interface, click on `Settings` and `Edit`.

### Entry

The first tab is the **entry** tab, containing the most basic fields.

#### Name

A campaign needs a world, containing at least 4 characters. Campaign names aren't unique (we wouldn't want a single _Tal'Dorei_ now would we?). A campaign's name can be changed at any time.

#### Description

A short (or long, we don't judge!) description of your campaign. A preview of this displays on the campaign's dashboard, and the full text is available when clicking on `Settings` in the sidebar.

``` {admonition} Friendly tip
This field can contain mentions to entities of the campaign!
```

#### Sidebar image

Select an image from your device or from a url to upload as the campaign's image. This image is visible in the campaign switcher and on the top of the sidebar.

### Sharing

The second tab focuses on sharing the campaign's content with people who aren't in the campaign. You can find out more about this [here](/features/campaigns/public-campaigns)

### Interface

This tab controls some basic look and feel of the campaign.


#### Campaign theme

Rather than displaying the campaign in the user viewing it's preferred theme, you can force the campaign to appear in a specific theme.

#### Campaign's member list

Control who can see the campaign's member list. This list is available in `Settings > Members`.

#### Entity history logs

Control who can see individual entity's change logs.

#### Tooltip - Entity's image

By default, tooltips that appear when hovering an entity link don't display that entity's image. This can be changed with this option.

#### Default entity's connections interface 

When clicking on an entity's **connections** subpage, select what displays. On premium campaigns, the default is to show the **relation explorer**.

#### Default relations explorer mode 

When opening an entity's **relation explorer**, control which mode is opened by default.

#### Default lists layout

Select if nested entities display in a user's preferred layout, or if you want to force nested lists.

#### New post default collapsed value 

Control if newly created [posts](/features/posts) are collapsed by default.

### Permissions

This tab allows you to set the default privacy and visibility settings of new elements created in the campaign.

#### Default new entity privacy 

When creating a new entity as an admin, select the default privacy setting of the new entity.

#### Related Elements Visibility 

When creating a new post, quest element, inventory item, or any other object with a **visibility** field, define which value is selected by default.

#### Default character personality visibility

When creating a new character as an admin, select the default privacy setting for its personality traits.

#### Show private entity names when they're mentioned.

When mentioning a private entity on another's entry or posts the mention will be rendered as the entitie's name for users who can't normally see it, if disabled, the entity's name will instead show as `Unknown`.

### Dashboards

The last tab controls info displayed on the dashboard's [campaign header widget](/guides/dashboard#ampaign-header).
