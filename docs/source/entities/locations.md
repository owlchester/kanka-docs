# Locations

Locations are places something or someone can be in, be it a tavern, a city, a planet, and yes, even a vehicle!

## Location Fields

Let's have a quick overview of fields that are unique to locations.

* **Parent location**: This allows you to define the *parent* of the location you're creating. For example, if you're creating Paris, the parent location might be France.

## Profile section

The [profile section](features/profile-sidebar) of a location will include any [maps](entities/maps) that have their location field set to the current map.
