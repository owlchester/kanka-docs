# Events

A festival, a war, a natural disaster. Things that happened in the past and are referred to in the present are events. These can then be linked to multiple calendars using reminders.

## Combining with calendars

Events live outside of [calendars](/entities/calendars). To add an event to a calendar, do so on the calendar's view, or on the event's [reminders](/features/reminders) subpage.
