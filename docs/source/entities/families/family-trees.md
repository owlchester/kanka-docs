# Family Trees

[Families](/entities/families) can have their family trees created in Kanka. This feature is currently limited to superboosted campaigns. To start creating a family tree, go to a family and go to their *family tree* subpage.

From there, click on *edit*, and click on **add a founder** button. 

## Founder

A family tree starts by a founder, which will be the first element of the tree. No character can be added before or above the founder. A founder can be change at any time.

## Relation

Each entity can have one or multiple relations, which are added by clicking on the **add relation** button. This brings up the form asking which entity to add, and what their relation is.

## Limitations

As with every new feature, there are currently some limitations.

* Children need exactly two parents.
* Sometimes there is extra spacing between branches.
* Family members are loaded to speed up setting a founder, but a character's relations aren't.
