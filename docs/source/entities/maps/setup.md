# Map Setup

Maps have many options. Let's go over some of them here and explain what they do.

* **Parent Map**: If this level 3 of a bigger dungeon that also is a map? If so, use the parent map to "place" this map inside another.
* **Location**: Useful if this map is the map of a kingdom, town, dungeon, etc. Link the location, and the map will be available in the location's profile sidebar.
* **Image**: This is the main image, which will serve as the map image, and also the thumbnail image of the map in lists.

## Settings

In the settings tab, you'll find the following fields.

* **Use OpenStreetMaps**: If you want to use a map from the real world instead of a custom image, check this option. You still need an image for the map, but it will only be used as a thumbnail.
* **Cluster markers**: After adding several markers on your map, it will quickly become messy and unreadable. This option clusters markers that are close together until you zoom in enough.

### Zoom levels

This fields control the zoom (aka when scrolling on a map) levels.

### Centering

By default, a map loads at coordinates 0,0. You can change this by providing new coordinates, or having your map center on a specific marker.
