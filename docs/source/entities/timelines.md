# Timelines

A tool to build the big picture evolution of a character, a kingdom, a planet, or your world's magnus opus. 

Timelines are split into eras, which represent narrative shifts between them. Each era is composed of elements. These can be linked to [events](/entities/events), other entities, or free-form text.

This module isn't for the nitty-gritty of representing time, but a chronological series of events that had a big impact. Think of a macro overview (the broad strokes of an empire's history). For the minute, micro focus, use [calendars](/entities/calendars).
