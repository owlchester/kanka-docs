# Creatures

The creatures module is a way to represent the creatures and species that inhabit your world. If your world has no use for this module, you can [disable it](/features/campaigns/modules).

## Creatures vs Races

A question that comes up is when to use the creatures module vs the [races](/entities/races) module. This is a fair question, and as always in Kanka, is up to the user.

The main difference between creatures and races, is that [characters](/entities/characters) can be assigned to races, while creatures live on their own.

In that sense, creatures are a **worldbuilding** element, while races are a **game mechanic**. Another way is to ask yourself if an entity of a race or creature can become a named character with motivations. If so, making it a race and character might make sense. However, if your players have the speak with animals spell and you name a blue jay creature, simply adding that name as an [alias](/features/aliases) might be enough.

## Changing the entity type

If you've created many creatures but meant to create races instead, you can easily [bulk change their entity type](/guides/transform).
