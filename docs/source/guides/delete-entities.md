# Deleting entities

There are several ways to delete entities from your world, for when your players (or if we're being honest here, it was probably you) created a or multiple duplicates of an NPC or location.

## Deleting a single entity

To delete a single entity, go to that entity, click on the cog wheel next to their name to open up the **action menu**. The last option will always be to delete the entity (if you have the right [permissions](/guides/testing-permissions)).
