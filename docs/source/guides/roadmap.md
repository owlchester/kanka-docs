# Public roadmap

To help us focus on features that add value to our community, we have a [public roadmap](https://app.kanka.io/roadmap), where members can submit new ideas and subscribers can upvote on ideas.

## Quick overview

The roadmap consists of ideas submitted by members and up-voted by subscribers. The first interface, **In progress**, shows ideas that have been approved by the Kanka team, split into categories and statuses.

* **Now**: These are ideas that the Kanka team is currently working on and will be available in the upcoming weeks.
* **Next**: These are ideas that the Kanka team have committed to work on in the near future.
* **Later**: Ideas that the Kanka team plan to add, but haven't yet committed to a timeframe.

The **Ideas** section shows ideas submitted by the community that have been approved by the Kanka team, and that subscribers can upvote. Whenever the team has bandwidth available, the highest up-voted ideas get moved to the previously described **in progress** section.

Lastly, the **Done** section will show ideas that have been added to Kanka.

## Submitting ideas

To submit an idea, go to the **Ideas** section and scroll to the bottom, where a form to add a new idea is available.

Once submitted, the idea needs to be approved by the Kanka team before appearing to upvote. Users get notified when their ideas get approved or rejected.

Ideas submitted by users who delete their account get deleted, unless their ideas have at least 10 up-votes.

### Rejection causes

Most ideas get rejected because they lack details, already exists, or don't fit with the team's vision for the product.

### Limitation

Please note that there is a limit of 10 ideas submitted by account per day.

## Up-voting ideas

Subscribers can upvote any amount of ideas from the **in progress** and **ideas** section. When a user's subscription ends, their up-votes stay as is. When their account gets deleted, so does their up-votes.
