# Keeping secrets

To avoid your players figuring out that the cultists are actually trying to bring back Tiamat to life with a magical ring that is found in a volcano, or that a friendly NPC is actually the BBEG, you'll want to set up secret information in your Kanka world.

This is achieved on multiple levels.

## Private entities

The first way to keep secrets is to have a whole entity private. This option is available when creating or editing an entity, below the entity's entry and tags fields.

Entities that are private only show up to members of the campaign's admin role. 

This also works for elements that links entities together. For example, if a PC's parent is the BBEG, you can create that relation. As long as the BBEG is private, a player won't see the relation on their character.

## Posts

Instead of keeping whole entities private, you can also have them know about a friendly merchant, but keep information about their past and motivations private by adding **posts** to them. Posts are texts that are displayed on the entity's overview page.

Each post can be made visible simply with the [visibility](advanced/visibility) option, or with custom permissions on the post.

## Visibility

Many elements that connect entities together, be it relations, inventory, reminders, timeline elements, etc have a [visibility](advanced/visibility) option, which can be used to make that connection secret to other members of the campaign.
