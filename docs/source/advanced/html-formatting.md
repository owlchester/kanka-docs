# HTML Formatting

The text editor in Kanka has a **source** mode, which gives you full control of how the layout will render. Kanka works on a whitelist system for HTML tags and properties, to avoid breaking the design and XSS attacks.

The list of allowed HTML tags and attributes can be seen on our [Github](https://github.com/owlchester/kanka/blob/develop/config/purify.php).

## CSS Class and Styling

Rather than writing classes and styling in the text editor, create [css styles in your campaign](features/campaigns/theming).
